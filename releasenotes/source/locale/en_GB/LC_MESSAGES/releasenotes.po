"A new configuration option has been added to the ``[oslo_policy]`` group "
"called ``enforce_scope``. When set to ``True``, oslo.policy will raise an "
"``InvalidScope`` exception if the context passed into the enforce method "
"doesn't match the policy's ``scope_types``. If ``False``, a warning will be "
"logged for operators. Note that operators should only enable this option "
"once they've audited their users to ensure system users have roles on the "
"system. This could potentially prevent some users from being able to make "
"system-level API calls. This will also give other services the flexibility "
"to fix long-standing RBAC issues in OpenStack once they start introducing "
"``scope_types`` for policies used in their service."
