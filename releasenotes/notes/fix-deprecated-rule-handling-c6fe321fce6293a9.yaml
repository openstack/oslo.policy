    Fixes handling of deprecated rules when generating sample policy files
    such that legacy rules are no longer automatically aliased in the
    resulting output. Previously, the behavior led to operator confusion when
    attempting to evaluate the output to determine if customized rules were
    required, as the aliases were always added as active rules. A warning
    is now also added to the generated output.
    For more information, please see `launchpad bug #1945336 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/oslo.policy/+bug/1945336>`_.
features:
  - Adds the ability to exclude deprecated policies from generated samples by
    utilizing the ``--exclude-deprecated`` setting when generating YAML
    example files. The Spinx generator can also be controlled using the
    ``exclude_deprecated`` environment variable. By default, these rules
    will be included, but operators and projects may not desire these
    deprecated rules to exist in latest documentation, espescially when
    considering the number of policy rules projects have made in the
    Secure RBAC effort.
