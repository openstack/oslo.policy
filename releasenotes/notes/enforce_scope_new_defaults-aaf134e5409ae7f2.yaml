upgrade:
  - |
    The default value of config options ``enforce_scope`` and
    ``enforce_new_defaults`` have been changed to ``True``.

    Most of the OpenStack services have enabled these options by
    default, and now it's time to change the default in the oslo
    policy itself.

    If you want to disable them, modify the values of these config
    options in the service configuration file (for example, "nova.conf")::

      [oslo_policy]
      enforce_new_defaults=False
      enforce_scope=False
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``enforce_scope`` configuration option was added temporarily
    to facilitate a smooth transition to the new RBAC. OpenStack will
    always enforce the scope checks, and they will not be configurable.
    This configuration option is marked as deprecated and will be removed
    in the 2025.2 cycle.
